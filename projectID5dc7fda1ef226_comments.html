<HTML><BODY>One of the first English books on the Japanese game of Go, sourced from the <a href="https://archive.org/details/gameofgonational00smit/page/n7">Internet</a> <a href="https://archive.org/details/gameofgonational00smitrich/page/n9">Archive</a>.

<p>The book contains numerous games with comments in two columns, which are basically very large tables, with the moves of black on the left and those of white on the right. They have been OCR-ed as two separate columns, placed in the text after each other, and you can leave them as such during the proofing rounds. During PP, I can, with relative ease, rearrange them by script, saving the proofers and formatters a lot of effort. Just make sure that during formatting the move numbers are properly marked as bold, and are preceded by an empty line.
